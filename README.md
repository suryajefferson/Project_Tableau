Welcome to the Airbnb Rooms Analysis Tableau project! This project is all about exploring and visualizing key insights from Airbnb listings, including the relationship between area and price, bedrooms and price, average price per bedroom, and booking patterns throughout the calendar year. Itâ€™s a great way to dive into data visualization and uncover trends that can help both hosts and guests make smarter decisions.
